\section{Introduction}\label{sec:Intro}
Do not worry about this for now


%Section~\ref{sec:SRAT} provides a brief overview of the tool's user interface, which is divided into three primary activities, including selection, analysis, and filtering Data~\ref{sec:Tab1}, model fit and prediction ~\ref{sec:Tab2}, and model evaluation~\ref{sec:Tab3}. Section~\ref{sec:Concl} concludes the paper and identifies future work.

\section{Software Architecture}\label{sec:Architecture}
This section presents...

User interface implemented in PyQt5, a plug-in for Python (Python bindings for Qt v5).

Need to have PyQt5 libraries installed

[example data sets, user guide links?]

Accepts input: failure times, number of failures at that time, 1 or more columns of covariate data

3(?) hazard functions implemented: Geometric, Negative Binomial (Order 2), and Discrete Weibull (Order 2)

Goodness of fit measures (AIC, BIC, etc..)

Functions of tool: fitting models to data, comparing goodness of fit, prediction

\subsection{xxx}\label{sec:Tab1}
%Description
Shows list of loaded models to choose

View imported data as graph or table

Select covariates to perform measurements on once data is loaded. Reads covariate names from data file. If no header, generic names (Metric1, Metric2, etc..) given to covariates.

\section{Model Specifications}\label{sec:Specs}
%Description
Generic model class contained in model.py in the core directory. Most definitions and methods are in model.py. Specific models are stored in the models directory, where one each model has its own file. This file can have any title, although for ease of use it is best to title the file the name of the model. The specific model must contain: an import of the generic Model class (from core.model import Model), the class must inherit from Model, a string containing the name of the model assigned to variable name, the initialization method (always exactly the same), and a calcHazard function. The calcHazard function takes one argument (b), and returns a list of values of the function evaluated for each discrete time of the imported failure data. 

% import generic Model class

% inherit from Model

% name = "Model Name"

% __init__() method (THE SAME FOR EVERY MODEL)

% calcHazard() method
%		where the unique hazard function is implemented
